1. `<direct.h>`
   To use _\_mkdir()_ function [ not *mkdir()* ] we need this header file. We will use **_direct.h_** instead of **_dirent.h_** [ Only found in Linux ] in this program. The function in this header file [ like **_mkdir()** ] starts with a underscore[ \_ ].

2. `<dirent.h>`
   This header file is only found in **Linux System**. For windows, we will use _<direct.h>_ as a replacement.

3. `<sys/types.h>`
   It is used to use the types of data in program

- `_getcwd()`
  It is used to get the path current directory | **\_\_getcwd(path, sizeof(path))** gives us the path of current directory in the _path_ variable.

## Custom Functions

<!--
******* Format *******
### functionName()
>`returnType functionName(arguments ...)`\
>    Name with link if this function is similar to any other function. Then a long description about the function. After that describe @Return Value (if any).
-->

### tracker_start()

> `void tracker_start()`\
>  Start the Tracker in current folder. It prints out if the Tracker is already started or, Started now or not.

### tracker_status()

> `int tracker_status()`\
>  Prints out if Tracker started or not in Current folder. Return, **0** - if Started already, **1** - if not Started.

### createFile()

> `int createFile(char *fileName)`\
>  It is used to create a new file. It takes a file name (path) as an argument.

### createFolder()

> `int createFolder(char *folderName)`\
>  Similar to [createFile()](#createfile) . It is used to create a new folder in. It takes a folder name (path) as an argument.

### isFile()

> `int isFile(char * filename)`\
>  It is used to check if the file exist or not. It returns **0** if the file exists and **1** if the file does not exist.

### isFolder()

> `int isFolder(char * foldername)`\
>  Similar to [isFile()](#isfile) . It is used to check if the folder exist or not. It returns **0** if the folder exists and **1** if the folder does not exist.
